The code branch is created for development of AForge.NET version 2.0.

The initial version of the branch is not made as a copy of existing
development version, because some of the classes will be modified
quite a lot. Instead of this classes will be merged in iterative
manner – merges will occur from time to time when corresponding classes
are going to be ported/reviewed. This means that initially the branch
will be empty, but it will grow as soon as more classes are ported.

At this point there are no any known estimates on when the AForge.NET 2.0
will become available. The set of new features is not finalized. Everything
in the branch is a subject for potential change. All the information will
become available on project’s home page, when there is something to share with.

There are no guarantees that the code in the branch works correctly and can
be built without issues. The branch is 100% aimed for developers, not for
the framework users. If you are willing to start using the code – OK, but don’t
expect we’ll support you. If you are willing to join and contribute – you are
welcome.

Unless the AForge.NET 2.0 is released, all the code in this branch should
be considered as GPL licensed, what does not allow its usage in closed
sources applications.
